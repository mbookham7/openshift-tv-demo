# OpenShift TV Demo

In this repo are two demos for RedHat OpenShift TV. The first demo shows how the CockroachDB Operator can be used to deploy a CockroachDB database into an OpenShift cluster. The second demo shows how you can use RedHat OpenShift Database access to deploy and Cloud Database on Cockroach Cloud and connect this to a node.js application running in the OpenShift cluster.
